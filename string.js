// 2. Exploring String Manipulation in JavaScript
// Objective: The aim of this assignment is to acquaint students with various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including string length, case conversion, substring extraction, and string splitting.

// Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that demonstrates different string manipulation operations. The program should cover obtaining the length of a string, converting cases (upper and lower), extracting substrings, and splitting strings based on a delimiter.

// Task 1: Obtaining String Length - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `length` property to obtain the length of the string.

// let message = "Hello, World!";
// Expected Outcome: Students should be able to understand how to determine the length of a string in JavaScript.

// Task 2: Converting Cases - Create a string with mixed-case content. - Use the `toUpperCase` method to convert the string to uppercase. - Use the `toLowerCase` method to convert the string to lowercase.

// let text = "Hello, World!";
// Expected Outcome: Students should be able to demonstrate the ability to convert strings between uppercase and lowercase in JavaScript.

// Task 3: Extracting Substrings - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `substring` method to extract a substring from the original string.

// let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
// Expected Outcome: Students should be able to extract substrings from a given string using the `substring` method in JavaScript.

// Task 4: Splitting Strings - Create a string containing multiple words separated by spaces. - Use the `split` method to split the string into an array of words based on the space delimiter.

// let sentence = "The quick brown fox";
